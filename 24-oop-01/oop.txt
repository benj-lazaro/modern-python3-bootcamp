What is OOP?
- A way to model things in the world (model) and write it in code as a class or an object

Class
- Blueprint of an object
- It contains attributes (similar to dictionary keys) and methods (functions)

Object
- An instance of a class or constructed from a class
- It contains the class' attributes and methods


Why OOP?
- To encapsulate code into logical, heirarchical groupings (basicallly organize stuff) using classes
- In order to reason code at a higher level

Encapsulation
- Grouping of public and private attributes & methods into a class
- Making abstraction possible

Abstraction
- Exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface
- Hide private attributes and methods (inner workings) from users
