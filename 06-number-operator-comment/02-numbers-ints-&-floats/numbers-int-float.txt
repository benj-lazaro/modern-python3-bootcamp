Numbers: Ints and Floats
------------------------
- The ways that Python represents numbers
    - Int (Integer)
        - Represents whole numbers (e.g. 4, 57, -10)
        - It consumes less memory than a Float

    - Float (Floating Point)
        - Represents decimal numbers (e.h. 6.1, 1.3333, 0.9)
        - It consumes more memory than an Int

    - Complex
        - Rarely used

    - Long
        - Rarely used


- The Python function "type()"
    - Returns the type of the specified object

Syntax:

type(<object>, [bases], [dict])


- The Python interpreter is NOT just a gloried calculator
    - It can combine numbers and operators in a single expression

    - NOTE: Performing a mathematical operation between an Int and a Float
        - If any part of the mathematical expression contains a Float
        - The end result ALWAYS evaluates to a Float
