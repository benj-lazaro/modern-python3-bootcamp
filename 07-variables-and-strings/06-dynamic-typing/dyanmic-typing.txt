What The Heck is Dynamic Typing
-------------------------------
- Python is a Dynamically Typed programming language
    - It allows a variable to readily change
        - The data type of its assigned value at any point of the program execution


- Static Typing is the opposite
    - It prevents a variable from readily changing
        - The data type of its (initially) assigned value
