Introduction to Variables
-------------------------
- A variable is like a container
    - To store some data that can be pulled out later
        - It can hold all sort of things
        - e.g. numbers, booleans & strings

    - It is assigned with a name

    - It is similar to variables in mathematics
        - Wherein it is a symbol that holds a value


- To assign a value to a variable in Python
    - Variables are ALWAYS assigned with the variable name on the left
        - The value on the right of the "=" operator

    - NOTE: Variables MUST be assigned with a value
        - Before it can be used / referenced

    - Variables can be assigned to other variables

    - Variables can be re-assigned with a new value
        - At any given time throughout the code execution

    - Multiple variable can be assigned with a value on a single line
        - Each variable & its corresponding value are separated by a comma


Syntax:

<variable_name> = <value>
<variable_name> = <variable_name>
<variable_name_1>, variable_name_2>, <variable_name_3> = <value_1>, <value_2>, <value_3>
