String Concatenation
--------------------
- It basically boils down to adding multiple strings together
    - Using the + operator

- Concatenating a string with an integer using the + operator
    - Triggers a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

- The operator += is a shortcut for re-assigning variables
    - It basically updates the value stored inside a variable
    - It is NOT limited to string but on other data types such as int, float


Examples
--------
# Using the + operator
name = "Colt"
name = name + " Steele"

# Using the += operator
name = "Colt"
name += " Steele"
