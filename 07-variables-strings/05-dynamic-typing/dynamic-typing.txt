Dynamic Typing
--------------
- Python is a highly flexible about re-assigning the values in a variable to a different data type
    - This is referred as Dynamic Typing
    - The data type of a value assigned to a variable can readily changed

- This is the opposite of Statically Typing
    - The data type of a value assigned to a variable can NOT be changed
    - These variables are stuck to the originally assigned data type
    - It will continually expected to be assigned with a value of the same data type
