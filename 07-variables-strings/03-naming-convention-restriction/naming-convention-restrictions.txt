Variable Naming Conventions & Restrictions
------------------------------------------
- A Python variable MUST
    - Begin with a letter or underscore
    - The rest MUST constitute of letters, numbers or underscores

- A Python variable is CASE-SENSITIVE
    - Variables with identical names but of different casing are treated as different variables

Example
--------
# Allowed variable name
_cats = 20

# Illegal variable name
# Triggers a SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal
2cats = 20

# Python interprets CATS & cats as different variables
CATS = 10
cats = 10
