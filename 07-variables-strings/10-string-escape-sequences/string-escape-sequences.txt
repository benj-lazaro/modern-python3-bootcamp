String Escape Sequences
-----------------------
- In Python, escape sequences are "metacharacters"
    - These characters are interpreted by Python to do something special

    \\      = backslash
    \'      = single quote
    \"      = double quote
    \a      = ASCII bell
    \b      = ASCII backspace
    \f      = ASCII form feed
    \n      = ASCII linefeed
    \r      = ASCII carriage return
    \t      = ASCII horizontal tab
    \v      = ASCII vertical tab
    \000    = character with octal value
    \x00    = character with hexadecimal value
