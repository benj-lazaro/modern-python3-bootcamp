Introduction to Variables
-------------------------
- Variables are like containers that:
    - Store data
    - Pulls data out later
    - Hold different sorts of data (e.g. Boolean, Integer, Float, String, etc.)

- Variables are like mathematical variables
    - It is a symbol that has a name
    - It holds a value

- To assign a value in a variable
    - Python uses the assignment operator =
    - The variable is located on the left-hand side of the assignment operator
    - The value is located on the right-hand side of the assignment operator


Syntax
------
<variable_name> = <value_assigned>


Variable as a Value
-------------------
- The variable itself can be assigned as a value to another variable
    - The value of the 1st variable is copied as value to the 2nd variable
    - If the value of the 1st variable is changed, the value of the 2nd variable is unchanged


Multiple Assignments
--------------------
- A group of variables can be assigned with initial values on a single line of code
    - Using the , operator


Syntax
------
<variable_a>, <variable_b>, <variable_c> = <value_1>, <value_2>, <value_3>
